 WHY SUSTAINABLE REAL ESTATE?
Sustainabe real estate si the development,
construction and management of properties in a way that minimizes their environmental impact, conserves natural resources, and promotes social responsibilities.
I t involves adopting practices and technologies that reduce energy consumption, water usage, waste generation and carbon emissions, while also prioritizing occupant health, safety, and wel being.
Sustainability is today's standard. Across industry and regions, it improves the quality of our lives, protects our ecosystem and preserves natural resources for future generations.
In building construction, sustainability si acentral component to the design and construction of modern buildings. In line with the sustainability
aspirations of most modern organizations,
an overall trend sees consumers and developers becoming more aware of the environmental impacts of real estate on the environment.
In Nigeria, adoption of green building standards si still low. By revealing accessible routes to implementation, energy efficiency in buildings
provides the opportunity to support Nigeria to gain traction in the adoption of measures and opportunities available in the country.
